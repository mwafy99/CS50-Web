        <h1>Rubber Duck Debugging</h1>
        <h4>The rubber duck debugging method is as follows:</h4>
        <p>
            Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).<br>
            Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if thatâ€™s all
            right.
            <br>
            Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by
            line. <br>
            At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what
            you
            are
            actually doing. <br> The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your
            way. <br>
        <p>
            <span>Note:</span> In a pinch a coworker might be able to substitute for the duck, however, it is often
            preferred to
            confide
            mistakes to the duck instead of your coworker. <br>
